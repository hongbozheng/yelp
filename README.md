# 🔍 Yelp Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze the Yelp dataset by focusing on businesses located in **Illinois**. The analysis involves extracting features, performing statistical analysis, applying association rule mining, and conducting N-gram analysis on reviews.

## 📂 Required Dataset

You must download the complete Yelp dataset from Kaggle:

- **[Yelp Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset)**

After downloading, extract the dataset to your local directory.

## ⚙️ Installation Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn mlxtend
```

---

## 📌 Steps to Run the Analysis

### 1. Prepare the Dataset

- Download the entire Yelp dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset).
- Extract all files to the `yelp/` directory within your `project/` folder.

---

### 2. Generate Illinois-Specific Subset

Run the `SaveIllinois.py` script to filter out businesses located in Illinois:

```bash
python SaveIllinois.py
```

This will generate a folder `yelp_illinois/` containing the following files:

```
├── business_illinois.json
├── review_illinois.json
├── user_illinois.json
├── checkin_illinois.json
├── tip_illinois.json
```

---

### 3. Run the Main Analysis

To perform feature analysis, probability calculations, and association rule mining, run:

```bash
python main_analysis.py
```

---

### 4. Run the N-gram Analysis

To conduct N-gram analysis on review texts, run:

```bash
python ngram_analysis.py
```

---

## 📈 Output

The scripts will generate outputs on the terminal, including:

- **Top feature values associated with high or low ratings.**
- **Important association rules extracted using the Apriori algorithm.**
- **Relevant N-gram phrases associated with high or low ratings.**

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

You can improve the analysis by:

- Adjusting the `MIN_SUPPORT_COUNT` for better filtering.
- Adding more features for association analysis.
- Optimizing the scripts for large datasets.
